Choose from several bash scripts to start your own.
</p>

---

A couple of scripts that serve as a starting point
for scripts that are a bit more than trivial.

## Features

- **skeleton-no-deps.bash** - basic bash script no dependencies
- **skeleton-with-ksl-lib.bash** - basic bash script using library `ksl-bash-lib`
- **usage-from-prolog-in-color.bash** - fragment showing using color in prolog

## Usage

* Choose a script from src folder
* Copy it (from clipboard, from clone, whatever)
* Then modify it for yourself
